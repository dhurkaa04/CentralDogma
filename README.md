Central Dogma of Molecular Biology Demonstration

Overview

This Java application demonstrates the central dogma of molecular biology using BioJava. The program accepts user input for a DNA sequence and its orientation (template or coding strand), performs transcription and translation, determines potential coding sequences (CDS), and ensures program completeness.

Features

- Accepts user input for a DNA sequence and its orientation (template or coding).
- Determines whether the sequence is a template or coding strand.
- Performs transcription to convert DNA sequence to RNA sequence.
- Translates RNA sequence into a protein sequence.
- Suggests whether the RNA sequence contains a potential coding sequence (CDS).
- Ensures program completeness by handling exceptions and providing informative outputs.

prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Maven installed for building the project
